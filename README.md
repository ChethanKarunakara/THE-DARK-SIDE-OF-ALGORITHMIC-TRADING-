THE DARK SIDE OF ALGORITHMIC TRADING: SECRETS WALL STREET WONT’T TELL YOU

In the age of data-driven decision-making, financial markets have become progressively reliant on algorithmic trading. These automated frameworks, powered by complex algorithms and endless datasets, execute trades at speeds and volumes that far outperform human capabilities. However, as we grasp this technological revolution, it's vital to remember that data interpretation is as much an art as it is a science. Misinterpreting financial data can lead to disastrous results, both for individual traders and the broader market.

•	Buy Signal (Green Triangle): Green triangles on the chart indicate "Buy Signals." These are points in time when the trading strategy suggests buying the stock, typically based on specific criteria such as when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average.
•	Sell Signal (Red Inverted Triangle): Red inverted triangles represent "Sell Signals." These points indicate when the trading strategy suggests selling the stock, often based on criteria such as when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.
